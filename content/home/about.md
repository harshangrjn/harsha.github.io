# Biography
I am currently staff scientist at the "Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics" division in Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). My primary research interests include development of efficient formulations and algorithms for modeling, design and control of complex physical systems. Particularly, I utilize tools from a myriad of disciplines including, mathematical programming and optimization (convex and nonconvex), control theory and uncertainty quantification. In recent years, at LANL, I have been focussing on various intersting problems arising in large-scale energy infrastructure systems.  

<p><b>Open Positions</b></p> 
<a href="https://github.com/lanl-ansi">  Advanced Network Science Initiative </a> at LANL is looking for motivated graduate students and postdoctoral research associates with interests in optimization, control theory, applied mathematics and energy systems. If working with talented scientists in a collaborative environment excite you, feel free to contact me.
